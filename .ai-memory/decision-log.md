# Decision Log

## Decision: Nyabag is desktop-first

- Reason: The primary workflows are visual, multi-panel, and canvas-heavy, which are best on large screens.

## Decision: Mobile is capture-first

- Reason: Mobile should stay useful for quick URL capture without trying to mirror the full desktop workspace.

## Decision: Supabase is the primary backend

- Reason: Auth, storage, RLS, and iteration speed fit the product better than a custom backend at this stage.

## Decision: `docs/NYABAG_TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md` is the canonical architecture doc

- Reason: Future agents need one long-form source of truth, with `.ai-memory/` acting as the short-form working memory.

## Decision: Module-level `"use server"` actions are the default mutation pattern

- Reason: Shared mutation files are easier to locate, document, and validate across bookmarks, canvas, folders, onboarding, and admin.

## Decision: Memory docs must be updated alongside meaningful repo changes

- Reason: Nyabag should become more self-documenting over time instead of accumulating stale agent context.

## Decision: Reminder scripts should be warnings-only

- Reason: A memory-check helper should point out drift without mutating the repo or hiding review work.

## Decision: Bookmark search uses TypeScript fusion over a large SQL hybrid RPC

- Reason: PostgreSQL should provide owner-scoped weighted lexical retrieval and pgvector candidates, while TypeScript fusion stays easier to test, tune, and integrate with existing visual-memory modules.

## Decision: Temporal bookmark search is deterministic

- Reason: Save-date language has a finite grammar and must respect browser timezone boundaries without spending Gemini calls or risking nondeterministic date interpretation.
