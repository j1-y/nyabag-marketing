# Nyabag Technical Documentation

Last updated: 2026-05-30

Nyabag is a desktop-first bookmark and notes workspace built with Next.js, Supabase, and React. It combines a visual bookmark moodboard with a FigJam-style infinite canvas for notes, links, media, social embeds, and grouped sections. This document is intended for future developers working on the codebase, deployment, debugging, and feature expansion.

## Product Overview

Nyabag helps users collect websites and visual references, then organize ideas on a canvas. The product has two main surfaces:

- **Bookmarks**: a clean visual moodboard of saved websites, with screenshots, extracted palettes, tags, summaries, detected fonts, and detail pages.
- **Notes**: an infinite canvas inspired by FigJam/Figma, supporting draggable and resizable notes, media notes, social embeds, and grouped sections.

The app is currently desktop-first. Mobile authenticated users see a small capture-only interface where they can submit URLs as real bookmarks, then continue working on desktop.

## Feature Inventory

### Bookmarks

- Add, edit, and delete bookmarks.
- Moodboard-style bookmark grid.
- Search by title, URL, summary, note, and tags.
- Tag filtering and recent filtering.
- Visual detail page for each bookmark.
- Full-page website screenshots through Microlink.
- Palette extraction from Microlink screenshot data where available.
- Fallback palette/font generation based on domain.
- Metadata scraping for title, summary, and inferred tags.
- In-app delete confirmation flow in bookmark UI.
- Pending bookmark UI while new bookmark creation is in progress.

### Bookmark Detail Pages

- Dedicated route at `/bookmarks/[id]`.
- Large screenshot preview.
- Domain/title/URL metadata.
- Extracted colors shown in designer-friendly categories.
- Detected fonts.
- Tags, summary, and external visit action.

### Notes Canvas

- Route at `/canvas`.
- Infinite canvas with panning and zooming.
- Fixed-size dot background that remains visually stable at different zoom levels.
- Two-finger trackpad panning in all directions.
- Ctrl/pinch wheel zoom at pointer.
- Select mode and pan mode with keyboard shortcuts:
  - `V` selects default pointer mode.
  - `H` selects hand/pan mode.
- Native cursor behavior:
  - select mode uses default cursor.
  - pan mode uses native `grab` / `grabbing`.
- Note creation by clicking or drag-sizing on the canvas.
- Supported note types:
  - text
  - link
  - image
  - video
  - social
- Drag and resize notes.
- Multi-select with marquee selection.
- Delete selected notes.
- Bring notes to front.
- Color picker per note.
- Persistent sections with labels.
- Wrap selected notes into a new section.
- Move sections and their member notes together.
- Resize sections without resizing notes.
- Rename and delete sections.

### Media Notes

- Image and video notes support URL-based media and uploaded media.
- Media dialog opens before image/video note placement.
- Upload tab supports drag/drop and file picker.
- Link tab supports URL input.
- Uploaded files are stored in private Supabase Storage under `canvas-media`.
- Uploaded media is rendered through signed URLs.
- Image notes render uploaded or external images.
- Video notes render uploaded videos with controls.
- YouTube and Vimeo URLs render as embeds.

### Social Notes

- Social note type supports public post URLs from:
  - X / Twitter
  - Facebook
  - LinkedIn
- Social URLs are validated before being stored.
- X/Twitter uses publish/oEmbed/widget behavior.
- Facebook and LinkedIn embeds are best-effort because public embed behavior depends on provider restrictions.
- Unsupported/private/restricted posts fall back gracefully.

### Profile

- Profile route at `/profile`.
- Stores name, email, phone, and optional avatar.
- Avatar uploads go to Supabase Storage bucket `profile-avatars`.
- Avatar public URL is derived from the storage path.

### Mobile URL Capture

- Login/signup remain available on mobile.
- Authenticated mobile users do not see the full desktop dashboard.
- Mobile users see a compact message that Nyabag works best on desktop.
- Mobile users can submit a website URL.
- The mobile URL uses the same `createBookmark` server action as desktop bookmark creation, so metadata, tags, palette, and screenshot behavior are shared.

## Routing and Layout

### Public/Auth Routes

- `/login`: email/password login UI.
- `/signup`: account creation UI.

### Authenticated Dashboard Routes

- `/`: bookmarks dashboard.
- `/bookmarks/[id]`: bookmark detail page.
- `/canvas`: notes canvas.
- `/profile`: profile settings.

The dashboard is wrapped by `src/components/layout/DashboardShell.tsx`.

`DashboardShell` responsibilities:

- Reads sidebar collapsed state from `localStorage`.
- Uses `useSyncExternalStore` to avoid hydration drift for sidebar/mobile state.
- Detects mobile width using a 768px breakpoint.
- Shows `MobileBookmarkCapture` on mobile.
- Shows sidebar, dashboard nav, and page children on desktop.

## Supabase Data Model

The complete schema lives in `supabase/schema.sql`. It is designed to be safe to rerun and uses `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` / `CREATE POLICY` patterns to avoid duplicate policy errors.

### `bookmarks`

Stores saved website references.

Important fields:

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | Bookmark UUID |
| `user_id` | Owner, references `auth.users(id)` |
| `url` | Saved website URL |
| `title` | Display title |
| `tags` | User and inferred tags |
| `palette` | Extracted or fallback colors |
| `fonts` | Detected or fallback fonts |
| `screenshot_url` | Microlink screenshot URL |
| `screenshot_refreshed_at` | Screenshot timestamp |
| `summary` | Metadata description summary |
| `metadata_refreshed_at` | Metadata scrape timestamp |
| `note` | User note |

Important constraints:

- URL max length: 2048.
- Title max length: 255.
- Summary max length: 1000.
- Note max length: 2000.
- RLS restricts rows to `auth.uid() = user_id`.

### `profiles`

Stores user profile metadata.

Important fields:

- `user_id`
- `name`
- `email`
- `phone`
- `avatar_path`
- timestamps

RLS restricts profile access to the owner.

### `canvas_notes`

Stores persistent notes on the canvas.

Important fields:

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | Note UUID |
| `user_id` | Owner |
| `section_id` | Optional section membership |
| `type` | `text`, `link`, `image`, `video`, or `social` |
| `content` | Text, link URL, video URL, or social-prefixed URL |
| `media_source` | `url`, `upload`, or null |
| `media_path` | Private Supabase Storage path |
| `media_mime` | Uploaded media MIME type |
| `media_name` | Uploaded original filename |
| `x`, `y` | Canvas position |
| `width`, `height` | Canvas size |
| `color` | Note background color |
| `z_index` | Render stacking order |

Important constraints:

- Note type check includes `social`.
- Media source must be null, `url`, or `upload`.
- Width min 100, height min 80 through application validation.
- RLS restricts rows to the owner.

### `canvas_sections`

Stores Figma-like sections.

Important fields:

- `id`
- `user_id`
- `label`
- `x`, `y`
- `width`, `height`
- `color`
- `z_index`
- timestamps

Sections are owner-scoped with RLS. Deleting a section should ungroup notes rather than delete them.

### Storage Buckets

| Bucket | Purpose | Visibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `canvas-media` | Uploaded image/video note files | Private, signed URL access |
| `profile-avatars` | User avatars | Public URL access |

`canvas-media` paths are structured under the user and note:

```text
{user_id}/{note_id}/{uuid}-{safe_filename}
```

The schema includes storage policies so users can only read/write their own object paths.

## Authentication and Security Model

Security is enforced at several layers:

1. **Route/layout layer**
   - Dashboard routes require Supabase session access through server-side clients.
   - Mobile users are gated to URL capture after authentication.

2. **Server action layer**
   - Every mutation calls `supabase.auth.getUser()`.
   - Mutations return `{ success: false, error: "Not authenticated" }` when no user exists.
   - Updates/deletes include `.eq("user_id", user.id)`.

3. **RLS layer**
   - Tables use row-level security.
   - Policies check `auth.uid() = user_id`.

4. **Storage layer**
   - Canvas media is private.
   - Signed URLs are generated server-side.
   - Media upload validates owner, note type, file MIME type, and file size.

5. **Validation layer**
   - Zod schemas validate bookmarks, profile updates, notes, sections, positions, sizes, and deletes.
   - Social notes validate supported social URL formats.
   - Media URLs are normalized and rejected if invalid.

## Bookmark System

### Bookmark Creation Flow

Main action: `createBookmark(formData)` in `src/lib/actions.ts`.

Flow:

1. Create Supabase server client.
2. Resolve authenticated user.
3. Validate form data with `bookmarkCreateSchema`.
4. Normalize/parse URL.
5. In parallel:
   - scrape metadata with `scrapeBookmarkMetadata(url)`.
   - fetch screenshot and palette with `getMicrolinkPreviewData(url)`.
6. Choose title:
   - explicit user title
   - scraped metadata title
   - formatted domain
   - raw URL fallback
7. Merge user tags with inferred metadata tags.
8. Resolve design data from known domain database or deterministic fallback.
9. Insert bookmark row.
10. Revalidate `/`.

### Bookmark Update Flow

Main action: `updateBookmark(formData)`.

Flow:

1. Validate input with `bookmarkUpdateSchema`.
2. Fetch existing bookmark metadata.
3. If URL changed, refresh scraped metadata and Microlink data.
4. If URL did not change, preserve screenshot, palette, fonts, and summary where possible.
5. Update the owner-scoped row.
6. Revalidate `/`.

### Bookmark Delete Flow

Main action: `deleteBookmark(id)`.

Flow:

1. Resolve authenticated user.
2. Delete bookmark by `id` and `user_id`.
3. If no rows were affected, distinguish between not found and wrong owner where possible.
4. Revalidate `/`.

The client currently performs optimistic delete in `useBookmarks`, then rolls back on failure.

### Metadata Scraping

Module: `src/lib/metadata.ts`.

`scrapeBookmarkMetadata(url)`:

- Fetches HTML with a 6 second abort timeout.
- Requires `text/html` response.
- Reads up to 250 KB of HTML.
- Extracts:
  - `og:title`, `twitter:title`, or `<title>`.
  - `description`, `og:description`, or `twitter:description`.
  - `keywords` / `news_keywords`.
  - JSON-LD text for classification signals.
- Applies category rules to infer tags like `ecommerce`, `design`, `development`, `ai`, `finance`, `social`, `video`, etc.

`mergeTags(userTags, inferredTags)`:

- Normalizes tags to lowercase slug-like strings.
- Deduplicates.
- Limits to 20 tags.

### Screenshot and Palette Retrieval

Module: `src/lib/data.ts`.

`getMicrolinkPreviewData(url)`:

- Calls `https://api.microlink.io/`.
- Requests:
  - `screenshot=true`
  - `fullPage=true`
  - `palette=true`
  - `filter=screenshot`
- Returns screenshot URL, palette, and refreshed timestamp.
- Returns null on errors.

`SCREENSHOT_REFRESH_INTERVAL_MS`:

- Currently one week.
- Used to determine screenshot staleness.

`getDesignData(url)`:

- Uses `DESIGN_DB` for known domains.
- Falls back to deterministic palettes/fonts based on domain character codes.

## Notes Canvas System

### Main Components

| Component | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `CanvasBoard` | Loads providers and canvas surface |
| `CanvasContainer` | Canvas viewport, pan, zoom, selection, placement, context menu |
| `CanvasToolbar` | Tool selection, note type buttons, media dialog trigger |
| `CanvasStatusBar` | Zoom controls/status |
| `CanvasNote` | Single note wrapper, drag behavior, selected state |
| `ResizeHandles` | Note resize handles |
| `NoteContent` | Type switch for note body |
| `NoteTextContent` | Text editing and blur-save |
| `NoteLinkContent` | Link input and preview |
| `NoteImageContent` | Image URL/upload rendering and edit controls |
| `NoteVideoContent` | Video URL/upload rendering and edit controls |
| `NoteSocialContent` | Social post URL input and embed rendering |
| `CanvasSection` | Persistent section rendering, moving, resizing, renaming |
| `MediaNoteDialog` | Image/video upload/link dialog before placement |

### Canvas State

Main hook: `useNotes` in `src/hooks/useNotes.tsx`.

Primary state:

- `notes`
- `sections`
- `toolMode`: `select` or `pan`
- `activeNoteTool`
- `pendingMediaNote`
- `isCreatingMediaNote`
- `mediaPlacementError`
- `viewport`: `{ x, y, scale }`
- `selectedIds`

Important behavior:

- Text/link/social tools activate placement immediately.
- Image/video tools open `MediaNoteDialog` first.
- Once media is selected, `pendingMediaNote` is stored and placement mode is armed.
- Notes can be click-created at default size or drag-created at custom size.
- Delete actions refresh from an authoritative server snapshot to avoid stale client notes.

### Canvas Pan and Zoom

Implemented in `CanvasContainer`.

- Pointer drag pans when:
  - middle mouse button is used,
  - space is held,
  - pan mode is active.
- Trackpad two-finger `wheel` without Ctrl pans the canvas in both axes.
- `wheel` with Ctrl/pinch zooms at the pointer.
- Zoom is clamped between `MIN_SCALE = 0.1` and `MAX_SCALE = 4.0`.
- Background dots are screen-space fixed at `24px 24px`.
- Background position follows viewport offset modulo 24px.

### Cursor Behavior

CSS in `src/app/globals.css`:

- Select mode uses native `default`.
- Pan mode uses native `grab`.
- Active panning uses native `grabbing`.
- Cursor is inherited across note/section surfaces to avoid flicker across nested elements.
- Controls and resize handles explicitly keep their expected cursors.

### Note Creation

Regular note action: `createNote(type, x, y, color, width?, height?)`.

Behavior:

- Authenticates user.
- Computes next `z_index`.
- Applies defaults:
  - most notes: `240x180`
  - social notes: `420x520`
- Validates with `noteCreateSchema`.
- Inserts owner-scoped row.
- Revalidates `/canvas`.

Note type detail:

- Social notes are intended to be represented with social content using `SOCIAL_NOTE_PREFIX`.
- The current implementation has special social handling in server and client code; verify stored `type` behavior if extending this area.

### Media Note Creation

New media-first flow:

1. User selects Image or Video tool.
2. `MediaNoteDialog` opens.
3. User chooses:
   - local file through drag/drop or file picker, or
   - URL through link input.
4. Dialog validates basic client-side constraints.
5. Canvas arms placement with `pendingMediaNote`.
6. User clicks or drags on canvas.
7. Server creates the note and attaches media.

Server actions:

- `createMediaNoteFromUrl(type, url, x, y, color, width?, height?)`
- `createMediaNoteWithUpload(type, formData, x, y, color, width?, height?)`

Upload limits:

- Images: 10 MB.
- Videos: 50 MB.

Upload behavior:

- Creates note row.
- Uploads file to `canvas-media`.
- Updates note with `media_source`, `media_path`, `media_mime`, `media_name`.
- Generates signed URL before returning.
- Rolls back note/storage if upload or attach fails.

### Existing Media Editing

Image/video notes still include body-level Change/Clear controls:

- `uploadNoteMedia(id, formData)` replaces uploaded media on an existing note.
- `updateNoteContent(id, content, color?, "url")` stores external media URL.
- `removeNoteMedia(id)` clears media fields and removes stored upload.

### Social Embeds

Module: `src/lib/social-embeds.ts`.

Important helpers:

- `SOCIAL_NOTE_PREFIX`
- `isSocialNoteContent(content)`
- `getSocialNoteUrl(content)`
- `toSocialNoteContent(url)`
- `parseSocialEmbed(raw)`
- `socialProviderLabel(provider)`

Supported formats:

- `x.com/.../status/...`
- `twitter.com/.../status/...`
- Facebook public post/permalink/photo/video/story URLs.
- LinkedIn posts and feed update URLs.

Provider caveats:

- X/Twitter embed rendering depends on platform widgets.
- Facebook public embeds depend on post visibility and platform restrictions.
- LinkedIn embed URLs are generated when an activity/share/UGC id can be parsed; otherwise fallback UI is used.

### Sections

Server actions:

- `createSectionFromNotes(label, noteIds)`
- `updateSectionLabel(id, label)`
- `updateSectionPosition(id, x, y, notes)`
- `updateSectionSize(id, width, height)`
- `deleteSection(id)`

Client behavior:

- Drag-select notes.
- Right-click selected notes.
- Choose "Wrap in new section".
- Enter label.
- Server creates section bounds using selected note positions with padding.
- Notes receive `section_id`.
- Moving a section moves member notes by delta.
- Deleting a section removes section and unsets member note `section_id`.

## Mobile URL Capture

Component: `src/components/layout/MobileBookmarkCapture.tsx`.

Flow:

1. Authenticated user opens app on mobile width.
2. `DashboardShell` renders mobile capture instead of desktop UI.
3. User submits a URL.
4. The component calls `createBookmark(formData)`.
5. On success, the bookmark is immediately available on desktop.

No separate pending mobile table exists. Mobile capture creates real bookmarks immediately.

## Profile System

Modules:

- `src/lib/profile.ts`
- `src/lib/actions.ts`
- `src/components/profile/ProfileForm.tsx`

`getUserProfile(supabase, user)`:

- Fetches profile row by `user_id`.
- Adds `avatar_url` from `profile-avatars` public URL if `avatar_path` exists.
- Returns a fallback profile object when no row exists.

`updateProfile(formData)`:

- Validates text fields with `profileUpdateSchema`.
- Validates avatar MIME and size.
- Uploads new avatar to `profile-avatars`.
- Removes old avatar when replaced.
- Upserts profile row.
- Revalidates `/profile`, `/`, and `/canvas`.

## Client State and Sync Patterns

Nyabag uses a mix of optimistic UI and server-confirmed updates.

### Bookmarks

- Bookmark creation uses pending UI while the server action performs metadata/screenshot work.
- Delete is optimistic in `useBookmarks`.
- On delete failure, previous bookmark state is restored.

### Canvas

- Content updates are optimistic, then replaced with server result.
- Failed content updates roll back to the previous note.
- Delete uses an authoritative server snapshot to remove stale IDs.
- Section wrapping filters stale selected IDs before server mutation.
- Media note creation is not rendered until the server successfully creates the media-backed note.

## External Integrations

### Supabase

Used for:

- Auth sessions.
- Postgres tables.
- Storage buckets.
- RLS policies.

Expected environment variables are typically:

```text
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
```

Confirm exact names in `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` and `src/lib/supabase/client.ts` before deployment.

### Microlink

Used for:

- Full-page screenshots.
- Screenshot-derived color palettes.

Important operational note:

- Free-tier Microlink limits can be exhausted quickly.
- Nyabag stores screenshot URLs and refreshed timestamps so screenshots do not need to be regenerated on every login.

### Provider Embeds

Used for social notes and videos:

- YouTube iframe embeds.
- Vimeo iframe embeds.
- X/Twitter widgets/oEmbed.
- Facebook embed SDK.
- LinkedIn embed iframe where parseable.

CSP is configured in `next.config.ts`; update it when adding new media/embed providers.

## Environment and Deployment Notes

### Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

### Supabase Setup

1. Create Supabase project.
2. Run `supabase/schema.sql` in the SQL editor.
3. Confirm buckets/policies exist:
   - `canvas-media`
   - `profile-avatars`
4. Add Supabase environment variables to `.env.local`.
5. Restart the dev server.

### Vercel Deployment

1. Push repo to GitHub.
2. Import project in Vercel.
3. Add Supabase environment variables.
4. Deploy.
5. Confirm Supabase auth redirect settings include the deployed domain.

## Build, Lint, and Quality Status

Current observed status:

- `npm run build` passes.
- `npm run lint` fails on unrelated legacy script files:
  - `check_db.js`
  - `test_microlink.js`

Lint failure cause:

- Both files use CommonJS `require()`, which violates `@typescript-eslint/no-require-imports`.

Existing warnings:

- Several UI files use raw `<img>` tags, triggering Next.js image optimization warnings.
- Some auth/layout files have unused variables related to older logo handling.

## Known Issues

1. **Lint errors in debug scripts**
   - Files: `check_db.js`, `test_microlink.js`.
   - Cause: CommonJS `require()` imports.
   - Impact: `npm run lint` exits non-zero.
   - Suggested fix: convert to ESM imports or exclude debug scripts from ESLint.

2. **Raw `<img>` warnings**
   - Several components use `<img>` directly.
   - Impact: lint warnings only.
   - Reasonable for external, dynamic, or signed media, but should be reviewed case-by-case.

3. **Microlink dependency**
   - Screenshot and palette extraction depend on Microlink availability and free-tier quota.
   - Nyabag stores screenshot URLs/refreshed timestamps, but new bookmarks and changed URLs still call Microlink.

4. **Social embeds are provider-dependent**
   - Private, deleted, region-restricted, or unsupported posts may fail.
   - LinkedIn public embedding is inconsistent.

5. **External media URLs may fail at render time**
   - Some domains block hotlinking or require CORS/anti-bot checks.
   - Uploaded media is more reliable because it uses Supabase Storage.

6. **Schema cache after Supabase changes**
   - Supabase/PostgREST may need a short refresh after schema updates before new columns are recognized.

## Fixed Issues and Changelog Notes

### Supabase schema rerun safety

- Policies now use `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` before recreation.
- This fixed duplicate-policy errors such as `policy "select_own_bookmarks" already exists`.

### Canvas social note schema support

- `canvas_notes.type` validation includes `social`.
- This fixed check constraint failures when creating social notes.

### Canvas sections

- Added `canvas_sections`.
- Added `canvas_notes.section_id`.
- Added persistent section wrapping, moving, resizing, renaming, and deletion.

### Stale deleted notes

- Canvas delete actions now return fresh server snapshots.
- Client selection is filtered against current server note IDs.
- This reduces stale note IDs causing later operations to fail.

### Text note save-on-blur

- Text notes use local draft state and save on blur.
- Failed saves roll back to server content.

### Fixed-size canvas dots

- Background grid no longer scales with zoom.
- Dot spacing stays visually stable while panning and zooming.

### Trackpad pan and native cursors

- Two-finger trackpad scroll pans in both axes.
- Ctrl/pinch wheel zoom remains available.
- Pan mode cursor uses native `grab` / `grabbing`.
- Cursor inheritance prevents hover flicker over notes and sections.

### Media dialog before image/video notes

- Image/video tools now open a dialog first.
- User chooses upload or link before placement.
- Notes appear only after server creation/upload succeeds.
- Upload failures do not create empty notes.

### Mobile desktop-only capture

- Mobile authenticated users see a URL capture form instead of the full dashboard/canvas.
- Submitted URLs create real bookmarks through the existing bookmark pipeline.

### Bookmark detail hydration date issue

- Date display was adjusted to avoid server/client locale mismatch issues.

### UI cleanup

- Dashboard moved toward a cleaner layout.
- Moodboard became the default bookmark view.
- Redundant view/ribbon controls were removed.
- Universal dashboard navigation/sidebar shell was added around dashboard pages.

## Suggested Future Improvements

1. Convert debug scripts to ESM or move them outside lint scope.
2. Replace simple alert-based bookmark delete rollback with an in-app toast/dialog.
3. Add Playwright smoke tests for:
   - bookmark create/delete,
   - canvas note creation,
   - media upload,
   - section wrapping,
   - mobile URL capture.
4. Add a self-hosted screenshot worker to reduce Microlink dependency.
5. Store richer metadata extraction results with versioning.
6. Add paste-to-create canvas notes.
7. Add minimap or "fit to content" refinements for large canvases.
8. Add collaborative cursors/multiplayer only after persistence is fully stable.
9. Add monitoring around screenshot failures and storage upload failures.
10. Consider a dedicated migration system instead of only maintaining `supabase/schema.sql`.
